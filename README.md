# `phono-word-gen`

Deployed here: <https://bigyihsuan.github.io/phono-word-gen/>

This project stems from a general dissatisfaction
of the various "generate a random word given a phonology" tools and websites
floating around the internet.
See [`thoughts.md`](./thoughts.md) for my ~~list of grievances~~ pros and cons on each tool
(that I know of).

## Project Goals

- Use TypeScript as the back-end and logic layer.
- Set up and host the front-facing site on GitHub Pages.
- Implement, at minimum, the "Minimum" features in [`desired-features.md`](./desired-features.md).
- ~~Have fun while doing so.~~
